   * John Tukey was very indiosyncratic, having been home schooled, and so had unusual means of self-expression; he also drew on an unusually
broad array of knowledge (he was trained as a chemist before entering mathematics)
   * Data are here now, they’ll be coming on more and more in the future, we must analyse them, often using very humble means, and insistence on mathematics
   * Data Analysis was a potentially huge field, into which statistics – with its grounding as a subdiscipline of the mathematical sciences, via probability theory, decision theory, and analysis – fit only as a small segment.
   * data analysis is an activity all its own, a kind of lifelong avocation; one does not need to be a mathematician to be a data analyst – in fact there is no connection, one could as well be a biologist, etc.
   * a data analysis community crystallized around Tukey’s conception, and its descendant communities are visible today, a substantial body of academic and industrial statisticians that emphasize data analysis over mathematical analysis and proof.
