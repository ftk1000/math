    * DEF: "preorder" on P is a relation (a subset of PxP) which reflexive (x<=x) and transitive (x<=y,y<=z => x<=z)
    * NB: a preorder is a category with at most one morphism between any two objects
    * NB: a preorder is a Bool-enriched category
    * DEF: Intersection A is a subset of a preorder P. For p in P we say p is a 'meet' of A iff p is a greatest lower bound of A 
            I.e., p<=a, for all a in A (p is a lower bound of A)   AND  q<=p for all similar q in P
    * for such p we write p = \bighat A = 'a1 \hat a2 \hat ... an'
    * NB: Similarly join is a least upper bound
    * Example 1. Bool. P={T,F}. F->T. Truth table for hat is AND table, truth table for join is OR table.
    * Example 2. P=Power set of S. a<=b iff a is a subset of b. If A is a subset of P, then meet A is intersection of all a in A.

    category - network of relations: examples [0..30], a->b, iff b is a multiple of a
    functor - connection between categories 
    (a,b) - product of 'a' and 'b' = the last thing that 'goes' into both 'a' and 'b'. For the example above (a,b) = lcd(a,b), eg (10,6)=2
