[Godel Incompleteness Theorem:  this statement is not provable from axioms of mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4ndIDcDSGc)<br>
  - Godel coded the following STATEMENT **"THIS SENTENCE CANNOT BE PROVED FROM THE AXIOMS"** into an equation. 
  As an equation it must be either TRUE or FALSE. 
  - If it is is FALSE, then this statement must be provable from the axioms, hence TRUE, contradiction.
  - We are assuming that MATH is consistent, i.e., it cannot have contradictions.
  - Thus the equation (the **STATEMENT**) must be TRUE. So there is a statement that is not provable.
  - Paris-Harrington Theorem (1977): a statement about numbers that is true but not provable.
  - If we can prove that Riemann Hypothesis is undecidable, then it must be true, because if is false, it must be decidable.
