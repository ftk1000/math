# Power of MATH:

* [Grant Sanderson: 2020: What Makes People Engage With Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_L-fp8gDzY)<br>
* [Dan Finkel: 2016: Five Principles of Extraordinary Math Teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytVneQUA5-c)<br>

       1. start with a question
       2. students need time to struggle
       3. you are not the answer key
       4. say YES to students' ideas (saying 'YES' does not mean 'YOU ARE RIGHT')
       5. play to math is the same as books to reading
